# Kolderkid Web App – Developer Guide

## Purpose
Migrated from React Native to a modern web stack (Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Redux Toolkit). The goal is to adapt all features and screens for the web.

## What’s Done So Far
- Core authentication (login/register) with token storage and route protection
- Onboarding slider for auth pages
- Sidebar navigation with icons, active state, and responsive drawer/collapse (collapses to icons on small screens, expands on toggle)
- Main dashboard (Home) with horizontally scrollable and conditionally rendered sections for Music, Videos, Podcasts, Apparels
- API integration via RTK Query (with pagination and details endpoints)
- Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Audio Player Screen with basic controls
- List pages for Music, Videos, Podcasts, Apparels with infinite scroll and dynamic breadcrumbs
- Product/Apparel details page (web) matching mobile app
- Dynamic breadcrumb component with back button on all detail/list/player pages
- Home page banner with overlay text and clickable dots
- ProfileSidebarSection overflow fix
- Improved sidebar and navigation responsiveness
- Video Player
- Podcast Player

## What’s Next
- Migrate and polish remaining screens from the original app
- Improve error handling and loading states
- Add tests and deployment scripts
- Further refine UI/UX for accessibility and performance
